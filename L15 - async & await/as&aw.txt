    => An async function is a function that returns a promise. It can contain one or more await
    expressions, which pause the execution of the function until the awaited promise resolves.
    Here's the syntax: {

        async function functionName() {
            // Asynchronous code using await
            const result = await someAsyncFunction();
            return result;
        }
        
    }
} 

2- {
    => The await keyword can only be used inside an async function. It's used to pause the execution
    of the function until the promise is resolved. It then returns the resolved value of the promise.
    If the promise is rejected, it will throw an error that you can catch using try...catch.
