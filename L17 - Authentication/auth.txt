[Authentication]
    => Authentication in JavaScript often involves interactions with a server to verify user
    identity and grant access to certain resources. One common approach is using tokens, such
    as JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), in combination with server-side logic to authenticate and authorize
    users. Here's a high-level overview of the process: {
        1- User Registration and Login
        2- Token Generations
        3- Sending the Token With Request
        4- Token Validation
        5- Authorization
    }

    => Authorization Header: {
        The Authorization header is used to send the authentication token (JWT) to the server.
        It's formatted as "Bearer <token>", where <token> is the actual JWT. This header informs
        the server that the request is authenticated.
    }

    => Request Body Parameters: {
        = The information you include in the request body can vary depending on the specific use case.
        Here are a few scenarios where you might need to include data in the request body: {
            1- Login:{
                When logging in, you typically send the user's credentials (e.g., username and password)
                in the request body. The server validates these credentials and responds with a JWT if
                they are correct.
            }
            2- Register {
                During user registration, you might send information like username, email,
                and password in the request body. The server creates a new user account and
                responds with a JWT.(JSON Web Token)
            }
            3- Updating User Profile: {
                If you need to update user profile information, you might include the updated
                details in the request body. The server can then process the changes based on
                the authenticated user.
            }
            4- Access Controll and Premissions: {
                For certain actions that require premissions, you migt need to provide additional
                information in the body parameter to indicate the intended action and any assosiated 
                data.
            }
        }
    }
